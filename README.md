# Manzana Apple Music Downloader

A python program to download albums and songs with `AAC` codec in `.m4a` container format and music-videos upto 4K in `AVC` or `HEVC` codec in `.mp4` format from Apple Music. This python program uses the module called pywidevine that is a python implementation of Google's Widevine DRM (Digital Rights Management) CDM (Content Decryption Module). This doesn't support to download spatial audios (Dolby Atmos) and Apple Lossless audios (ALAC) because those are not protected with Widevine. They are protected with the FairPlay. [FairPlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay) is a digital rights management (DRM) technology developed by Apple Inc.
